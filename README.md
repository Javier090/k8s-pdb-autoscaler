## Introduction

This originated as an intern project still at github.com/Javier090/k8s-pdb-autoscaler

The general idea is that k8s deployments already have a max surge concept and there's no reason that surge is only for new deployments and not for node maitence.
It captures evictions using a webhook and writes them to a PDBWatcher CR if it exists. A controller will then try and temporarily scale up the deployment that corresponds.

### Why 
Overprovisioning isn't free. Sometimes it makes sense to run as cheap as you can. But you still don't want to be down because there was a cluster upgrade or even a vm maintence event.
Your app might also just be having a bad time for unrelated reasons and an the same maitence event shouldn't cost you down time if extra replicas can save you.

## Features

- Web hook that writes evictions to pdb watcher custom resource.
- Controller that wathces pdb watchers and if evictions are blocked because watchers PDB's disruptionsAllowed is zero then surge deployment.
- Controller Restores deployment when evictions go through with

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- kind for e2e tests.
- A sense of adventure

### Install

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/paulgmiller/k8s-pdb-autoscaler.git
cd k8s-pdb-autoscaler
hack/install.sh
```

## Usage
Here's how to see how this might work.

```bash
kubectl create ns laboratory
kubectl create deployment -n laboratory piggie --image nginx
hack/autodeploy.sh laboratory #want to replace this with tagging namespaces.
# show a starting state
k get pods -n laboratory
k get pdbwatcher piggie-pdb-watcher -n laboratory -o yaml
go run ./cmd/evict --label app=piggie -ns laboratory
# show we've scaled up
k get pods -n laboratory
k get pdbwatcher piggie-pdb-watcher -n laboratory -o yaml
# okay one more eviction to get us back down to one replica
go run ./cmd/evict --label app=piggie -ns laboratory
```



## TODO 

###  Tactical 
- Work with stateful sets.
- Make the webhook cheaper. 
- e2e
- kustomize
- cert manager.
